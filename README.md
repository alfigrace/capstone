# C22-PS020 - Capstone Project (Paranmo)
Welcome to Machine Learning repository of Paranmo Application (From Bangkit Capstone Project Team C22-PS020)!

See the link of C22-PS020: Team Repository

This repository is managed by the Machine Learning members:

- M7414F2984 Alfi Nazilah

## The Process
In developing this application, there are some processes that we had done:

- import libraries needed
- mounting google drive
- checking amount of data in each label
- load the dataset and split it into train, validation and test dataset with 8:1:1 ratio
- display some image examples from dataset
Testing
User Research

The user research was done by all of the team members. We did the research by asking some people and evaluating some comments on the existing similiar applications. Then we gained some user's pain points. The pain points were crucial part to know what must be done for the better development. We also made a competitive research.
